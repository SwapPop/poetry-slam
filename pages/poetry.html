          <h3>Gravity</h3>
          <p>The diamond on my finger matches the stars <br/>
            as I swoon in your arms like a wave <br/>
            broken on the shore. I’ve danced to your tune <br/>
            long enough that I know every move— <br/>
            in and out, up and down, over and through: <br/>
            I bend to you like the tide to the moon. <br/><br/>
            But the earth pulls on us, heavy, <br/>
            it calls you to fall to me forever but never <br/>
            to touch the waters that mirror your lune. <br/>
            You say turn on three: “One, two…” <br/>
            I step too soon and wonder: Does the tide <br/>
            ever tire of pleasing the moon? <br/></p>

          <h3>Glossed</h3>
          <p>My eyes double hers in the halogen <br/>
            light of Sephora’s checkout line. <br/>
            Her eyes are vacant, mine expectant, <br/>
            our smoky stares cemented in the <br/>
            silky polish of a magazine page. <br/>
            Her cameraman must have used an <br/>
            ethereal lens. A soft box distributes <br/>
            light evenly across her pixie features <br/>
            and reflectors bounce glowing orbs <br/>
            into the pupils of her eyes. <br/>
            Her software-softened skin has the <br/>
            sheen of melted plastic and her neck <br/>
            rises above her shoulders like <br/>
            stretched taffy. Leather bands <br/>
            wrap her arms like a straight jacket. <br/>
            My face is engorged in front of hers, <br/>
            a ghostly reflection—distorted <br/>
            by the curving bend of the page. <br/>
            I look up at the lady across from me <br/>
            at the counter. She dressed like Miss America <br/>
            for work, her eyes lined in blue and purple. <br/>
            I hand her my money and leave <br/>
            the store. At home I leave orange <br/>
            makeup wipes on the bathroom floor. <br/></p>

          <h3>Why I Write Poetry:</h3>
          <h4><em>Response to Major Jackson</em></h4>
          <p>Because I can’t reach the top shelf of my kitchen cabinet <br/>
            Because the sun is a globe of fire <br/>
            Because sometimes I wear headphones and look out the window <br/>
            to avoid other people <br/>
            Because there are bookstores on London corners that I’ve not yet seen <br/>
            Because once my mom threw up off the side of a boat and came face to face with a <br/>
            whale <br/>
            Because I’m not sure I want my children to believe in fairytales <br/>
            Because when it rains the brush by my house turns purple and it reminds me that <br/>
            the world bruises too <br/>
            Because he said once that he saw me everywhere he looked <br/>
            Because the sky is dappled with stars that have already burned out <br/>
            Because I grew up singing that I was a child of God <br/>
            Because the songbird’s bones were designed for flight <br/>
            Because I used to fall asleep to the humming noise of my parents’ television set <br/>
            Because another girl was shot dead on a college campus yesterday and there’s no <br/>
            reason for any of it <br/>
            Because the last time I called my Grandpa Stan he still remembered my name <br/>
            Because the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain <br/>
            Because humans measure time by the length of shadows <br/>
            Because in second grade I watched from behind a red brick pillar as the other girls <br/>
            played Little Sally Walker <br/>
            Because I spent this afternoon studying weighted blankets instead of business <br/>
            strategies <br/>
            Because its been proven that if you never use your eyes you’ll eventually lose your <br/>
            sight <br/></p>

          <h3>Mother of Eve:</h3>
          <p>You’re like a <br/>
            specter <br/>
            snuggled just behind <br/>
            my shoulder, <br/>
            or a memory <br/>
            I can’t quite place: <br/>
            the smell <br/>
            of hand soap <br/>
            Momma used <br/>
            when I was younger, <br/>
            or old perfume <br/>
            in Grandma’s embrace. <br/>
            There’s something <br/>
            so tangible <br/>
            about you, <br/>
            I can almost feel you there, <br/>
            but when I sketch in <br/>
            the shadows of your frame <br/>
            my own silhouette <br/>
            begins to appear. <br/></p>

          <p>It comes <br/>
              like bittersweet chocolate <br/>
              to a starving tongue. <br/>
              Unexpected <br/>
              not unwelcome. <br/>
              I salivate, <br/>
              storm, and <br/>
              sweat: <br/>
              afraid that just a touch <br/>
              is not enough. <br/>
              I grasp at half of the moon, <br/>
              an unsung verse, <br/>
              and abandoned love-- <br/>
              take them under my flapping wings, <br/>
              and beg them to survive <br/>
              and thrive <br/>
              within me. <br/>
              <em>It’s okay.</em> <br/>
              I say. <br/>
              <em>Don’t be alarmed.</em> <br/>
              These things will come and go, <br/>
              ebb and flow, <br/>
              I won’t fight their retreat. <br/>
              Instead I’ll make friends <br/>
              with every imperfect end.<br/></p>
